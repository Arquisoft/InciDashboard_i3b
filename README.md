# Incident Management System (Group i3b)
This module is part of the project implemented for the laboratory assignment of the course "Software Architecture". The course is part of the Degree in Software Engineering, School of Computer Science Engineering, University of Oviedo. The whole system is divided in four modules developed by two subteams ([Team A](https://github.com/orgs/Arquisoft/teams/course1718_i3b2) and [Team B](https://github.com/orgs/Arquisoft/teams/course1718_i3b1)). These modules are:

* Module 1.- [Loader](https://github.com/Arquisoft/Loader_i3b)
* Module 2.- [Agents management](https://github.com/Arquisoft/Agents_i3b)
* Module 3.- [Incidence Management](https://github.com/Arquisoft/InciManager_i3b)
* Module 4.- [Analysis and dashboard](https://github.com/Arquisoft/InciDashboard_i3b)

# InciDashboard
In this repository you will find the implementation of the first module. It allows the visualization and management of the incidents by the operators (properties, information about the incidents, state...). It will receive the incidents submitted by the [InciManagement module](https://github.com/Arquisoft/InciManager_i3b) via Apache Kafka and it will allow the visualization of the geolocated incidents in a map, as well as their values, state and evolution.
